## 🧭 Human Interface Guidelines

This package follows Apple’s official Human Interface Guidelines for the iPadOS menu bar. Before designing your menus, review these resources to ensure consistency with the system experience:

* WWDC session on the iPadOS menu bar: [https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/208/?time=624](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/208/%3Ftime%3D624)
* Apple HIG – Menu Bar: [https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar)

## 🚀 Features

Bring the native iPadOS menu bar experience to your Flutter applications with this custom `PlatformMenuDelegate`. Elevate your tablet and desktop apps with responsive, adaptive navigation menus, custom status icons, and keyboard shortcuts.

## 📦 Installation

Add `ipados_menu_bar` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ipados_menu_bar: ^0.6.0

```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get

```

> [!NOTE]
> The iOS plugin supports both **Swift Package Manager** and **CocoaPods**. When Swift Package Manager is enabled in your project, the Flutter tool uses it automatically; otherwise it falls back to CocoaPods. No extra setup is required either way.

## 📚 Examples

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Basic Setup

Initialize the iPadOS menu bar in your app's `main()` method:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:ipados_menu_bar/ipados_menu_bar.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.platformMenuDelegate = IPadOSPlatformMenuDelegate.create();

  runApp(MyApp());
}

```

And everything just works now! Please check out the included examples to learn how `PlatformMenu` works and how to use it on your application.

## 🎛️ Customization Options

### Hidden Default Menus

The package allows you to hide default system menu items that come with iPadOS:

* **File**: Hide file-related actions
* **Edit**: Hide editing actions (cut, copy, paste, etc.)
* **Format**: Hide text formatting options
* **View**: Hide view-related controls

These menus will be automatically hidden when there's a `PlatformMenuBar` on the current context and haven't been placed in the widget tree:

```dart
PlatformMenuBar(
    menus: [
        // File and Format will be hidden
        IPadEditMenu(
            onUndo: () => debugPrint('Undo action!'),
            onRedo: () => debugPrint('Redo action!'),
        ),
        IPadViewMenu(),
    ],
)

```

### Disable Menu Items

On custom menu items, you can disable menu items by setting the `onSelected` or `onSelectedIntent` to a null value:

```dart
// Controlling when an item should be clickable using a boolean
PlatformMenuItem(
  label: 'Item 0 (Enabled: $enabledBoolean)',
  onSelected: enabledBoolean
      ? () => debugPrint("Item 0 selected")
      : null,
),

```

This is extremely useful when changing contexts, like opening a modal, and you want to prevent unexpected user actions.

### Add Icons to your items

You can use either `IconData` with the `icon` attribute or a `Widget` using the `iconWidget` attribute on `PlatformMenuItemWithIcon`, `PlatformMenuWithIcon` and `StatefulPlatformMenuItemWithIcon`.

> [!NOTE]
> Icons are natively rendered on iPadOS. On macOS and other desktop targets, they gracefully fallback to standard text items following the system guidelines.

```dart
// Disabled items will have their icon's alpha lowered
PlatformMenuItemWithIcon(
  label: 'Disabled item',
  icon: Icons.favorite
),

PlatformMenuItemWithIcon(
  label: 'Icon widget!',
  iconWidget: FlutterLogo(),
  onSelected: () {
    print("Flutter Rocks!!");  
  }
),

```

### Set a state to your item

Menu items can have three different states: *off*, *on* and *mixed*.

> [!NOTE]
> Interactive item states are fully supported on iPadOS targets.

```dart
StatefulPlatformMenuItem(
  label: 'Unchecked',
  state: MenuItemState.off
),

StatefulPlatformMenuItem(
  label: 'Checked',
  state: MenuItemState.on
),

StatefulPlatformMenuItemWithIcon(
  label: 'Mixed',
  state: MenuItemState.mixed,
  icon: Icons.question_mark
),

```

### Menu Structure

Create organized menu hierarchies with:

* **`PlatformMenu`** – Defines a top-level menu category.
* **`PlatformMenuItemGroup`** – Groups related menu items and automatically separates them from others.
* **`PlatformMenuItem`** – Represents an individual menu action, optionally with a keyboard shortcut.
* **`PlatformMenuWithIcon`** – A top-level menu that includes a leading icon.
* **`PlatformMenuItemWithIcon`** – A single menu action that includes a leading icon.

#### Default Apple-style Menus

These are prebuilt menu categories designed to follow Apple’s native iPadOS behavior, while allowing custom items and callbacks:

* **`IPadAppMenu`** – Allows you to access the Application menu and add your own items.
* **`IPadFileMenu`** – Manages file-related operations such as opening, saving, or creating new documents.
* **`IPadEditMenu`** – Provides standard edit actions (undo, redo, cut, copy, paste) integrated with iPadOS, plus your own callbacks.
* **`IPadFormatMenu`** – Handles formatting-related actions for text or data with system-consistent structure.
* **`IPadViewMenu`** – Allows switching between views, toggling panels, or controlling UI visibility (e.g., showing the sidebar).
* **`IPadWindowMenu`** – Enables window management and lets you define entry points for new windows, each with its own Flutter view and arguments.

## 📱 Platform Support

This package offers dual-optimized behavior for Apple ecosystems and responsive applications:

| Platform | Support Level | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **iPadOS 26+** | 🚀 Native Enhanced | Full support for icons, stateful items, and Apple HIG menu automatic layout arrangement. |
| **macOS** | 💻 Fully Compatible | Executes flawlessly using `DefaultPlatformMenuDelegate` maintaining your defined widget tree hierarchy exactly. |
| **Other Platforms** | 🛡️ Safe Fallback | Automatically uses default delegates to ensure application stability and avoid crashes on non-Apple targets. |
